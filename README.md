IDEATION

This project went through a large ideation cycle, while I usually arrive at a concept within a relatively short space of time,
I decided to take my time on this project to produce something that was: 

a) Realistic to produce within the production timeframe
b) Within reach of my current coding and programming knowledge/skillset
c) A personally interesting/unique concept to engage with
