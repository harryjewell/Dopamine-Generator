HOW TO OPEN SITE WITH CODE ONLY
Please download the code from Github and run from microsoft Visual Studio with ritwickdey.LiveServer extension.
When extension is installed click the "Go Live" button in the blue section of the bottom right hand corner of Microsoft VS
to see the site display properly. Otherwise, the fully functional site may be viewed on glitch.


IDEATION ====================================================================================================================
This project went through a long ideation cycle, while I usually arrive at a concept within a relatively short space of time,
I decided to take my time on this project to produce something that was: 

a) Realistic to produce within the production timeframe.
b) Within reach of my current coding and programming knowledge/skillset.
c) A personally interesting/unique concept to engage with.


PRODUCTION PROCESS ==========================================================================================================
After deciding on the "Dopamine Generator" concept, I built out the basic site layout using an established "card" system, 
utilizing simple HTML and CSS to determine the sites responsiveness and overall layout.

The concept itself was drawn from prior knowledge of and research into existing API's that I believed would be relatively 
simple to deploy to the site with my current skill level. With help from Ben I was able to get an "Advice" API bringing in
new advice on each refresh of the site.

With help from Ben and some experimentation I was able to introduce a dog API to the site, retrieving a new picture of a 
dog on each refresh of the page. Further experiments allowed me to connect a "not so functional" spotify API after 
following some tutorials on youtube, and generating a series of gifs from a selected search term on the site using the 
Giphy API.

In class Ben helped me with some simple solutions to easily embed a spotify player using spotify's API, and get the giphy
API functioning. Taking the project home I worked on styling the existing elements and adding animations to the site.

After a lot of struggling with some pretty mid-tier CSS I managed to get things looking pretty good regarding layout, 
out of the realm of basic and into the realm of early 2000's web design aesthetic, the project came closer to looking
like what I had pictured in my head day by day.

Finally, on the approach to the final due date of the assignment, I recieved some help from Jarryd B (peer and fellow student).
Jarryd helped with adding the remaining desired functionality, being getting a new picture of a dog on each click of the
"new doggo" buttons, and looking into the possibility of targeting the "next song" button in the spotify widget with the
"new music" button in the sites navbar.

After a few hours ideation, testing and efforts the site was entirely functional, we added the "rave party" function, 
dramatically increasing the sites "novel" capacity.
After the code sesh I added comments to all of the code, deleted obselete code, and minimally altered some of the site styling.

I've added some media queries with comments for responsive display on smaller screens to finalise the code and handle
some display issues (header height, quote text size rendering new quote button non functional).
Next I'll upload a final Github commit, post that commit to glitch to create a live site, and submit the final assessment 
of my degree, what a milestone.

Huge thanks to Ben and Jarryd for helping me through this one! If you've read through this, you're a real one.
Cheers!
